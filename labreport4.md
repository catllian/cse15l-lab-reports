## Challenge Task Procedure
## Step 4: Log into ieng6
* Type: `ssh cs15lwi23avv@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>`
* This logs into the ieng6 account on a remote computer.
## Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
* The SSH key can also be found at the GitHub repository link [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) in your browser. Go to the "Code" dropdown, then the "Local" section, then the "SSH" section. Click on the button to copy the SSH key.
Type: `git clone <Ctrl + V> <enter>"
* This clones the repository fork from the GitHub account into the remote computer
## Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
* The compile command can be found on the Week 3 webpage of the CSE 15L website at the link [https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week3/](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week3/) in your browser. Go to the "Lab Tasks" section, then the "Setup" section, and it will be under "MAC USERS:". Use <Ctrl + C> to copy the compile command
Type: `<Ctrl + V> <enter>`
(To clarify, the command that was entered was `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java`).
* This compiles the Java and JUnit library files.
* Part of the run command can be found on the Week 3 webpage of the CSE 15L website at the link [https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week3/](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week3/) in your browser.
